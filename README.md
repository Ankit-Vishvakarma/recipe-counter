# Recipes Frontend

Single-page React application that lets users perform **free-text searches** against a backend recipes API and view results in a responsive grid. It supports **client-side sorting** (by `cookTimeMinutes`) and **client-side filtering** (by `tags`). The app follows clean-code patterns (atomic design), uses environment variables for configuration, and demonstrates lazy-loading and responsive UI.

## Features

- Global search bar (Google-style) â€” free text search by recipe name, cuisine or any searchable field.
- Searches trigger only after user types **at least 3 characters** and presses **Enter** or clicks **Search**.
- Displays results in a responsive grid of recipe cards.
- Client-side sorting by `cookTimeMinutes` (ascending / descending) without calling backend again.
- Client-side filtering by recipe `tags` (OR semantics: recipe included if it contains any selected tag).
- Clean error / empty-state messages and loading indicators.
- Atomic component structure for reusability.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v16+ (or latest LTS)
